# calculator

This is the calculator project from The Odin Project's Javascript Foundations course. I was tasked with building a functioning calculator using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

# Challenges

- evaluate a single pair of numbers at a time
- string together several operations 
- add keyboard support  

# What I Learned

- how to run a function only once on page load
- another way to both write to a variable with a function and access/rewrite that data later
